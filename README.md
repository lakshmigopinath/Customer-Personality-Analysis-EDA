# EDA
Performed EDA of Customer Personality Analysis Dataset

 Problem Statement
The challenge is to segment customers based on purchasing behaviors, demographics, and interactions to enhance marketing strategies. Without detailed segmentation, marketing efforts may be inefficient and fail to target relevant customer groups effectively.

Objective
The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:

Explore and summarize the dataset to identify patterns and distributions.
Determine key attributes that define customer behavior and demographics.
Visualize data to uncover potential customer segments.
